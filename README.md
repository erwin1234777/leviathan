- Emotes that you post in chat
- Amount of times you used the commands (analytics)

#### Twitch Information :
This bot is capable of doing cross currency between Discord and Twitch. Meaning the points you are awareded from minigames and other rewards are able to be used between both platforms. If you earn 20 coins, you get those 20 coins both on twitch and discord. (shop and others incoming soon enough).
- To get started, head over to the [TWITCH](https://www.twitch.tv/leviathanapp), then go in CHAT(even if offline), and type n.susbcribe. Or, click [HERE](https://www.twitch.tv/leviathanapp/chat) to get directly to chat, and type n.subscribe
- After it has been added, type anything in your stream chat to check if the bot replies to it (it will register you on the first message you send), alternatively, try n.test to see if the bot is properly placed in your chat.
- That's it, users are now able to do the commands listed in the Minigame section and spend those points across your Discord and your Stream chat! 
- Remember that 'n.command' may be detected as a link, users are able to use 'n. gamble' , with spaces in between to avoid that if you have links disallowed in your chat!

## Visual Tutorial 

- First, to start things off, you must be in a server with the bot in it. You can add it via invite [HERE](https://github.com/erwin1234777/leviathan#add-this-bot-to-your-server) or if you already have in your Discord server, ignore this step.
- Second, you must go to Twitch, either if your Streamer has the bot on their chat, or use the [Official Bot Page](https://www.twitch.tv/leviathanapp) to get started.
Thats it, those are the requirements, now follow along!

You can start by typing ``n.register`` in your Discord chat.  
 
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0g7OQKw.png" width="320">

Second step, is going on the bot's chat or your streamers chat.
Then you'll type ``n.link``, which then the bot will DM you.
### MAKE SURE YOU HAVE DM's OPEN
Copy the whole link, ``n.link`` plus the big ID it will give you.


<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5grF3lT.png" width="680">

Once thats done, now its time to head over to Discord and paste that big link the bot DM'd you.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9CIY1ws.png" width="300">

### Thats it!
Remember that those steps are only for Streamers that dont have the bot on their chat. You wont be needing to come to my stream to link your account, all this can be done on the streamer's chat once the bot is setup on their end!
Well, for Users thats it. If you want the bot on YOUR stream aswell, keep following these steps!

### Add me to your stream!
Let get started. Head over to [Official Bot Page](https://www.twitch.tv/leviathanapp/chat).
Then type ``n.subscribe``. Make sure you are the Streamer, it'll subscribe to the user who types the command, you cannot subscribe on someones behalf

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Nqqjbny.png" width="300">

That's it, the bot should be on your stream now.

Some extra things you might wanna keep in mind. Try ``n.test`` on your stream to check the bot.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/NXZLprI.png" width="300">

You can then change the ``PREFIX`` from ``n.`` to ``!`` or whatever else you want, remember that it can ``ONLY be MAX 3 Characters long``. @Command, #Command, !Command, are all avaliable!

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZG3yjRv.png" width="300">

Thats it, you are done! Check the [TWITCH COMMANDS](https://github.com/erwin1234777/leviathan#twitch-commands), and try them on your stream.
No setup, no downloads, just a couple messages away from using this Free Bot! Hope you enjoy!
